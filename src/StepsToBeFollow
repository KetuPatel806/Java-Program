Step 1 :- See whole Problem and List out A data what question Say
Step 2 :- think a bruteForce(worst time complexity) solution
Step 3 :- If u see that are a sorted arrays some type of question to Searching Than
          use Only Binary Search.
Step 4 :-if u see any question of Rotated Binary search
Step 5 :- 1)You have to pivot
          2)make a function of binary search for given target,start and end
          3)and reduce a length of a array to find a target
          4)make cases and possibilities.
